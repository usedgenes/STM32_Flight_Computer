## 10/29/2025 - Selected MCU, created power design, looked at examples  

For the initial steps of this flight computer, I looked at around 5 example STM32 based flight computers, reading their documentation and trying to understand their schematics. In addition, I also researched the different STM32 flight computers, and decided on the STM32F405 because it has the best balance of cost, cpu clock speed, and flash memory size. I also started designing how power will be handled for this board, with things like USB power vs battery power, and making sure they won't conflict with each other.

## 11/4/2025 - Added power, sensors, and other components  

Decided what sensors to use: BMP388 altimeter, bmi088 imu, and lis3m magnetometer. Selected these components because they are commonly used in other flight computers, so documentation will be really helpful. Also added an SD card for data logging. For power, I'm using a pmos to make sure power from USB never conflicts with power from battery, and I'm also using diodes for reverse polarity protection. Next step is just to connect all the pins to the STM, and then start actually routing the PCB.
